<!-- Bugs -->
1- module.exports = app; is listed 2x on app.js
2- User cannot patch own route. Updated user route to allow patching self. Added tests.
3- User can currently set self to admin, only admins should do that. Updated          
    User routes and added tests to cover all scenarios
4- Changed auth middleware to jwt.verify instead of jwt.decode - decode doesn't verify
    if jwt is legit and generated by the server. 
5- Updated getAll in user model to return basic info only, as specified in route. Added
    additional tests to make sure only the basic user info keys are returned.
6- Await missing from User.authenticate in routes/auth.js
7- Added throw to new ExpressError in model user.js get method

<!-- Not Really Bugs but made these changes -->

Grouped together beforeEach, afterEach, afterAll tests to beginning of route tests.
